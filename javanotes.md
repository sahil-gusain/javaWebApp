# LOGGING  

Logging is necessary for debugging and tracking user activities, as real-time debugging is not always possible for web applications. Therefore, debug logging is used.  

In Java web applications, we use the Apache Log4j framework to log information to various destinations, such as databases, consoles, files, etc.  

The Logger class in Log4j provides methods for logging. The common log levels are: ALL, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, OFF.   



# JAVA Notes  
The throw keyword in Java is used to explicitly throw an exception. The exception object, once created, is thrown to the calling method. The try-catch block is then used to handle the exception at the appropriate level in the code.
